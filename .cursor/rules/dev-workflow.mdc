# Dev Workflow

## Package Manager

- **Always use pnpm** for installs and all package operations
- Use `pnpm install`, `pnpm add`, `pnpm remove`, etc. — never npm or yarn

```bash
# ✅ GOOD
pnpm install
pnpm add some-package
pnpm add -D dev-dependency

# ❌ BAD
npm install
yarn add some-package
```

## Build & Dev Servers

- **Never run build commands** — the user will build when ready
- **Never run dev servers** — the user will start them

Do not suggest or execute `pnpm build`, `pnpm dev`, `next dev`, `npm run start`, or similar. The user handles builds and dev servers themselves.
